This code implements a simple web page that includes a login form. Below is a brief explanation of the HTML, CSS, and the fonts used in this project.

HTML:
The HTML section defines the basic structure of the web page.

It includes a <head> element that contains meta tags and links to CSS and fonts.

In the <body> section, there are two circles with blue and orange colors, and a login form with inputs for "username" and "password," along with a submit button.

CSS:
The styles for the web page are defined in a CSS file linked to the HTML file through <link rel="stylesheet" href="style/style.css">.

The "Poppins" font from Google Fonts is used in this project.

Styles for the body, login form, and colored circles are defined using CSS.

Various CSS techniques such as gradients for backgrounds and border-radius for creating circles are used.

Input fields and buttons are styled to provide a clean and user-friendly design.

This project overall includes a simple login page with an attractive and minimalist design implemented using HTML, CSS, and web fonts. I hope this explanation is helpful for adding to GitHub.
